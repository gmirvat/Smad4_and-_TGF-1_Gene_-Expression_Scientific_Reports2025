Selected Plots from Bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq Analyses
This section includes representative visualizations generated from the bulk and single-cell RNA-seq analysis code provided in this repository:

a) Volcano plots showing differentially expressed genes across timepoints and genotypes.
b) Pathway cnet plots displaying connections between significantly regulated genes and enriched pathways.
c) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the tmod package with hallmark gene sets.
d) Gene-specific expression trends comparing genotypes over time following TGF-β1 treatment.
e) UMAP plots visualizing single-cell expression profiles by genotype.
f) Violin plots of pseudobulk RNA expression for selected genes.
g) Point-range plots showing confidence intervals for absolute log₂ fold-change (obs_log2FC) across identified cell types.
h) Bar graphs showing relative frequencies of single-cell clusters between experimental groups.
